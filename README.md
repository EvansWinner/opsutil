# OPSUTIL

A few utilties I wrote for sysops use when the only programming
language available to me was DOS batch scripting.

pingls.bat --- ping each address in a flat file list of sites
	   Optionally include a delay between each attempt; ring the
	   system bell on failure.

et.bat --- ``Egg'' timer, i.e, a count-down timer.  Uses a line of vb
       script which it executes to time.  See the source.

filep.bat --- check the existence of all files named in a flat file
   	  listing them all.

See the batch files for information, or for pingls.bat just put it in
a directory, change to that directory in a DOS box, and type `pingls`
and hit enter.

High-tech they're not, but I found them useful in my work for a while.
